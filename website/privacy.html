            <strong>SlackNorris</strong> is a project for fun, not a business or knowledge base.

            <br/>
            We store absolutely nothing about you or your team.
            There's no database, files, cache, or any storage engine behind the website and API whatsoever.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            On top of all that, remember that <strong>Chuck Norris</strong> already knows everything about you so we don't have to store it.
